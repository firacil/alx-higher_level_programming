## Background Context

** In this project, you will link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

** In the first part, you will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

** In the second part, you will use the module SQLAlchemy (don’t ask me how to pronounce it…) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

** The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, your biggest concern will be “What can I do with my objects” and not “How this object is stored? where? when?”.
** You won’t write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, your code won’t be “storage type” dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.

## Learning Objectives
### General

** Why Python programming is awesome
** How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
** How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
** How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
** What ORM means
** How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
** How to create a Python Virtual Environment

## Requrinments
### General

** Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
** All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
** Your files will be executed with MySQLdb version 2.0.x
** Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
** All your files should end with a new line
** The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
** A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
** Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
** All your files must be executable
** The length of your files will be tested using wc
** All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
** All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
** All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
** A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
** You are not allowed to use execute with sqlalchemy
